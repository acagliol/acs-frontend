# Calendar Chunking Issue Fix

## Problem
The calendar page was experiencing code generation chunk issues due to Node.js-specific modules being imported on the client side. The error messages showed:

```
the chunking context (unknown) does not support external modules (request: node:fs)
the chunking context (unknown) does not support external modules (request: node:net)
```

This was caused by the `CalendarApiClient` class in `lib/api/calendar-client.ts` being imported and used directly in client-side components, which included Node.js dependencies like `googleapis` and `node-fetch`.

## Root Cause
The issue was that the calendar client was designed to run on both server and client, but it contained Node.js-specific modules that cannot be bundled for the browser. The `googleapis` library and related dependencies require Node.js modules like `fs`, `net`, etc.

## Solution
The fix involved moving all calendar API operations to server-side API routes and updating the client-side code to use these routes instead of the calendar client directly.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `hooks/useCalendarData.ts`
- Removed direct import of `CalendarApiClient`
- Updated all API calls to use fetch requests to server-side API routes
- Added proper error handling for API requests
- Maintained the same interface for components using the hook

#### 2. Updated API Routes
- **`app/api/calendar/google/route.ts`**: Added events fetching capability
- **`app/api/calendar/calendly/route.ts`**: Added events fetching capability
- **`app/api/calendar/google/auth-url/route.ts`**: New route for generating Google OAuth URLs
- **`app/api/calendar/calendly/validate/route.ts`**: New route for validating Calendly API keys

#### 3. Updated `components/features/calendar/CalendarIntegration.tsx`
- Removed direct import of `CalendarApiClient`
- Updated Google OAuth flow to use API routes
- Updated Calendly connection flow to use API routes

### Architecture Changes

#### Before (Problematic)
```
Client Component → CalendarApiClient → Node.js modules (googleapis, etc.)
```

#### After (Fixed)
```
Client Component → API Routes → CalendarApiClient → Node.js modules (googleapis, etc.)
```

### Benefits
1. **Resolved Chunking Issues**: No more Node.js module bundling errors
2. **Better Separation**: Clear separation between client and server code
3. **Improved Security**: API keys and sensitive operations stay on the server
4. **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in API routes
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and debug

### Files Modified
- `hooks/useCalendarData.ts`
- `app/api/calendar/google/route.ts`
- `app/api/calendar/calendly/route.ts`
- `app/api/calendar/google/auth-url/route.ts` (new)
- `app/api/calendar/calendly/validate/route.ts` (new)
- `components/features/calendar/CalendarIntegration.tsx`

### Testing
- ✅ Build process completes without chunking errors
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ Calendar functionality maintained through API routes
- ✅ All existing calendar features continue to work

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use API routes for operations that require Node.js modules
2. Keep client-side code free of server-only dependencies
3. Use the established data flow pattern with centralized API processing
4. Test builds regularly to catch bundling issues early
